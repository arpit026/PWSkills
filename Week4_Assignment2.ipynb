    "Answer 2: The four pillars of object-oriented programming (OOP) are:\n",
    "\n",
    "Encapsulation: Encapsulation is the process of bundling data and methods together within a class. It involves hiding the internal details of an object and providing access to the object's functionality through well-defined interfaces. Encapsulation allows for data abstraction and provides the concept of data hiding, which helps in protecting the integrity and consistency of an object.\n",
    "\n",
    "Inheritance: Inheritance is a mechanism that allows classes to inherit properties and behaviors from other classes. It establishes a hierarchical relationship between classes, where a subclass (derived class) can inherit characteristics from a superclass (base class). The subclass can extend or modify the inherited properties and behaviors while also adding its own unique features. Inheritance promotes code reuse, modularity, and the creation of specialized classes based on general ones.\n",
    "\n",
    "Polymorphism: Polymorphism means the ability of an object to take on many forms. It allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common superclass. Polymorphism enables methods to be defined in the superclass and overridden in the subclasses, allowing different objects to respond differently to the same method call. It promotes flexibility, extensibility, and code reusability by allowing the use of a common interface to represent various types of objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "Abstraction: Abstraction is the process of simplifying complex systems by modeling them at a higher level of abstraction. It involves capturing the essential features and behaviors of an object or a system while hiding the unnecessary details. Abstraction allows programmers to focus on the relevant aspects of an object, making it easier to understand and work with. It provides a way to create abstract classes or interfaces that define a common structure and behavior for a group of related objects.\n",
